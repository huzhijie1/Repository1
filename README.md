You can use two buttons to select pictures separately, but the two pictures must be the same size

You can also select the proportion of an image from the drop-down box. After selection, the proportion of an image will naturally change

Finally, click the Confirm button to get the fused image. If you are satisfied with it, you can click the Save button to save it
