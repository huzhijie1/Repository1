You can use two buttons to select pictures separately, but the two pictures must be the same size

You can also select the proportion of an image from the drop-down box. After selection, the proportion of an image will naturally change

Finally, click the Confirm button to get the fused image. If you are satisfied with it, you can click the Save button to save it

There are also some other functions, such as the two pictures do not have the same size, exe file，etc

If you need, you can leave a message below

Of course, if I have any mistakes or suggestions, I am welcome to point them out
